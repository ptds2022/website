### Slack
We will be using Slack for class-related discussion and questions, to help you benefit from each other’s questions and the collective knowledge of your classmates and instructors. Questions can be posted to the entire class (for content-related questions). I encourage you to ask questions if you are struggling to understand a concept, and to answer your classmates’ questions when you can.

### Email
Most matters, public or private, should be addresssed through Slack.
