The 30 points of the grade are allocated according to the following criteria:

- Overall quality (3 points)

<!--The semester project are peer evaluated: every group grades the others and send a brief report to the instructors. The instructors grade as well the project. The final points obtained for the project is given by taking 50% of the instructors' grades and 50% of the average from the other groups' grades.-->

<!--### Participation
Participation is graded based on both [Piazza](https://piazza.com/unil.ch/fall2019/ptds2019/home) (see the [communication page](https://ptds.netlify.com/syllabus/communication/)) and in-class activities. There are five points for each. 

In order to earn full credit for the Piazza portion, each student should make 1 or more substantive posts per week (except during the first week) related to the content of the course. A post can be a reply to another student's question. Grading is based on Piazza meta-data that can only be accessed by an instructor.

Due to the structure of this class, attendance is very important. Moreover, students will be encouraged to work in teams on in-class activities each week, so others are counting on you to be in class and contribute. Students with valid excuse should notify the instructor as soon as possible and provide a minimum of one week notice.

Each lecture will have its own magic word that you are responsible for entering into a form link that will be provided on Piazza. In order to be eligible to receive attendance points, you must be in class, enter the magic word within 5 minutes after it is given, and stay for the entire duration of the class.-->
